# CTF Web Scraper

## What do I want it to do?

- Tell me the next 10 CTF competitions that are in a certain criteria (mode, weight, participants, types of challenges)
- Sign up for the CTF through ctftime.org by clicking on a certain link with the "organizers blank"
- possibly make some type of discord bot that pulls a users ctftime standing 
- create something that will allow me to save it to a file, such as excel, or possibly an html doc that displays the logo of the ctf, when will it occur, basically the first thing above but with more visual flare!



## What sites do I currently want it to pull from?

`https://ctftime.org`
